VERSION 01072026_164301
RUN:
Ran all scripts for both SH and NH. CNN in both hempsipheres and WTD CNN in SH produced expected skills.
WTD CNN in NH was noisy.
LR and WTD LR in both SH and NH had sparse outputs (singular matrix, NaNs at many locations).
FIX: 
Had switched to assigining present day/ previous day variables after masking/ normalizing in this version.
Switching back to masking/ normalizing after assigning variables fixed sparse LR outputs in proceding version.

VERSION 01162026_164705
RUN:
Ran from mask-norm on for both SH and NH with fixes mentioned directly above. Expected skills.
Still encountering -inf skills in both hemispheres
(probably due to close to zero variance in true values giving zero division).
These points seem to be beyond the ice edge.
DEBUG:
Playing with ice concentration mask used in Hoffman et. al. based on percent time ice free (in addition to NSIDC mask, mask
locations where ice cocentration = 0 for > 90% of the time (v.s. 80 for Hoffman)).
The 90% mask captures points in SH with near zero variance with less area removed from domain than others (visually). Visual comparison
with negative skill.
Trying SH and NH with 90% threshold for ice free days.
Trying issue with
FIX: 
None yet - improvement but still seeing issues with skill.
NEW PROBLEM:
WTD LR for SH and NH maxed out negative skill and WTD CNN for NH showing noise - compare uncertainty stats for both hemispheres.

VERSION 01222026_1511
RUN:
Ran plots only with small epsilon correction in skill and weighted skill (1e-4). Still seeing large negative skill values.
Continue with masking.
DEBUG:
Added epsilon value for skills (had it previously, forgot to inlude it in these versions).

VERSION 01232026_1104
RUN:
Ran only lr_wtd_cf for NH and SH. Unique output for y_pred and y_true (test output)! Skill looks valid in both SH and NH! 
FIX:
Problem was likely memory allocation with np.full for y_pred and setting y_true = y_pred.

VERSION 01232026_1338
RUN:
Ran both SH and NH from mask-norm on with mask at spatial points with 80% days ice free threshold
Looks better! Still not perfect. Think about combining variance mask with
mask based on 80% or 90% threshold.

VERSION 01252026_
RUN:
Ran both SH and NH from mask-norm on with mask at spatial points with < 0.05 ice velocity
variance threshold.
