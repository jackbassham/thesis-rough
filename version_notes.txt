VERSION 01072026_164301
RUN:
Ran all scripts for both SH and NH. CNN in both hempsipheres and WTD CNN in SH produced expected skills.
WTD CNN in NH was noisy.
LR and WTD LR in both SH and NH had sparse outputs (singular matrix, NaNs at many locations).
FIX: 
Had switched to assigining present day/ previous day variables after masking/ normalizing in this version.
Switching back to masking/ normalizing after assigning variables fixed sparse LR outputs in proceding version.

VERSION 01162026_164705
RUN:
Ran from mask-norm on for both SH and NH with fixes mentioned directly above. Expected skills.
Still encountering -inf skills in both hemispheres
(probably due to close to zero variance in true values giving zero division).
These points seem to be beyond the ice edge.
DEBUG:
Playing with ice concentration mask used in Hoffman et. al. based on percent time ice free (in addition to NSIDC mask, mask
locations where ice cocentration = 0 for > 90% of the time (v.s. 80 for Hoffman)).
The 90% mask captures points in SH with near zero variance with less area removed from domain than others (visually). Visual comparison
with negative skill.
Trying SH and NH with 90% threshold for ice free days.
FIX:
